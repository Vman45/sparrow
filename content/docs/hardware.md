## Validated hardware
Sparrow has been tested and works perfectly on the following hardware:
* Raspberry Pi 4 Mod√®le B 4 Go: [Amazon FR](https://amzn.to/2ZOWTzp)
* SanDisk MicroSDHC Ultra 128GB: [Amazon FR](https://amzn.to/39x3K55)

### Benchmark
For the moment we have not yet made a functional benchmark, but it should come.

## Compatible hardware
Sparrow can run on any computer with armhf architecture.

We strongly recommend having 2 GB of RAM, If you do not have as much RAM, as on a Raspberry Pi 3B+, you can increase the size of the swap partition as described [here](../increase-swap-on-raspberry-pi).

Regarding persistent storage, it is necessary to have a fast SD card with a size of at least 16GB.
